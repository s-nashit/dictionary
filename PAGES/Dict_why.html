<div><p>   You can use a dictionary to look up the meaning of any 
  words that you don’t understand. However, there are lots of different 
  types of dictionaries, so which one should you use?

  <br><br> Let’s look at some of the different types of dictionaries
  to see which will be most helpful to you during your studies.

  <br><br>A dictionary is one of the most important tools during your time 
  studying at a university. A good dictionary can help you understand your 
  subject better, improve your communication, and improve your grades by making 
  sure you are using words correctly.

  <br><br> However, not all dictionaries are the same, and if you don’t
  know how to use a dictionary correctly, it could actually teach you the
  wrong meaning of a word and make it more difficult to get a good grade.
